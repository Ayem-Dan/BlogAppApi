# My Blog API Project README

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my Blog API project. This is a cool project I've been working on using the latest and greatest .NET 7.

## Project Overview

This API is designed to power my awesome blog. It allows users to read, create, update, and delete blog posts. It's all about sharing my thoughts and passions with the world.

## Tech Stack

- **.NET 7**: The heart of the project, providing us with the latest features and performance improvements.
- **C#**: The language that makes it all happen.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For managing our database and data models.
- **Swagger**: Because API documentation should be friendly and easy to use.
